## 1. The system (transcribed verbatim from the slides)

Coaxial three-mirror anastigmat, all mirrors on one axis. Prescription (CODE V):

| | ROC (mm, signed) | conic K (nominal) | spacing (mm, signed) |
|---|---|---|---|
| M1 | −12357.51782 | −0.992924471436 | M1→M2 −5267.903548 |
| M2 |  −2201.36673 | −1.92646737685  | M2→M3  7106.924338 |
| M3 |  −2687.97316 | −0.707216181423 | M3→focus −5095.367898 (paraxial) |

- **FOV:** 0.2° × 0.2° square. **Offset (stages 2–4):** +0.5° in Y.
- **EPD:** *not stated on any slide.* Recovered as ≈2003 mm from the slide-1
  layout drawing (scale bar 590 drawing-units = 1000 mm; M1 arc ≈ 1182 units);
  **Dave set EPD = 2000 mm.** ⚠ This is the one inferred input — see §5.
- Derived: EFL ≈ 3506 mm, **f/1.75**.

**CODE V → MACOS conventions applied** (`rodgers_common.m`): ROC → `KrElt=−|R|`
(convexity is geometry, not sign); K → `KcElt=K` directly; spacings passed as
magnitudes (the builder folds z with (−1)ᵏ); FOV/offset/tilts in degrees.
Rodgers reports WFE in waves @ 1000 nm; we convert ×1000 → nm.

## 2. Layout gate — PASSED (verify before trusting any WFE)

Built via `macos.design.Telescope` family=TMA, verbatim conics injected
(`add_mirror(...,'conic',K)` overrides the Seidel seed):

- M1→M2 = 5267.904 mm, M2→M3 = 7106.924 mm — **match his to the micron.**
- **Focus:** the builder's Seidel *seed* focus (+1212 mm → FP at z=+626 mm) is
  ~4× mis-placed — the known fast-relay seed limitation. But
  `align_focal_plane` **independently** (ray-bundle closest-point, seed-free)
  finds best focus at **z = −3256.30 mm**, matching Rodgers' verbatim paraxial
  M3→focus (−3256.35 mm) to **0.05 mm**. On-axis WFE there = **0.072 nm ≈ 0**.
- Conclusion: the optics are faithfully reproduced. `align_focal_plane` *is*
  Rodgers' "FPA focus" DOF; we call it before evaluating/optimizing each stage.

## 3. Headline result — the native optimizer recovers his conics to 4 dp

Stages 3–4 run **our** native optimizer (MACOS CALIB) with Rodgers' exact DOF
sets over the 0.2°×0.2° offset box and compare the **solved parameters**:

**Stage 3** (re-optimize the three conics + FPA):

| conic | MACOS | Rodgers | \|diff\| |
|---|---|---|---|
| K_M1 | −0.993475384 | −0.993352673 | 1.2e−4 |
| K_M2 | −1.932030835 | −1.932084692 | 5.4e−5 |
| K_M3 | −0.705426255 | −0.702494853 | 2.9e−3 |

**Our optimizer independently converges to essentially his CODE V solution** —
K_M1, K_M2 to 4 decimal places, K_M3 to 3. This is the strongest evidence the
reproduction is faithful: same starting Rx + same DOFs + same field → same
solved conics, two independent optimizers (CODE V vs MACOS CALIB).

Stage 4 conics also match to 3 dp (K_M1 2.8e−4, K_M2 3.5e−3, K_M3 6.0e−3).

## 4. WFE-magnitude and rigid-body deviations — FLAGGED FOR FABLE

Every stage's absolute field-map RMS WFE runs **4–6× off**, and Stage-4
rigid-body values disagree. Per the task, these are flagged, not tuned past.

### 4a. Field-map WFE magnitude = a METRIC-DEFINITION difference (not optics)

The discrepancy is present even in **Stage 1**, a pure evaluation with no
optimizer, and it goes in **opposite directions** (S1 too high, S2 too low) —
so it cannot be a uniform scale error. The signature:

| S1 on-axis box (nm) | min | max | avg |
|---|---|---|---|
| MACOS `realize_apertures` = std(OPD) @ one global plane | 0.31 | 8.00 | 2.61 |
| Rodgers (CODE V field map) | 0.45 | 1.46 | 0.61 |

The field **center** matches (0.31 vs 0.45 nm); the field-*dependent growth* is
~4.5× too steep. Decomposing the per-field OPD (`wfe_field_diag`, metric
ladder) shows why — and reconciles it:

| S1 metric (nm) | min | max | avg |
|---|---|---|---|
| raw (piston only) | 0.31 | 4.56 | 2.27 |
| − piston/tip/tilt | 0.17 | 4.13 | 1.23 |
| **− + defocus (per field)** | **0.03** | **1.83** | **0.62** |
| Rodgers (CODE V) | 0.45 | 1.46 | **0.61** |

The **per-field defocus-removed** average (0.62 nm) matches Rodgers (0.61 nm) to
**3%**. **Interpretation:** CODE V's "RMS wavefront error vs field" references
each field to its own best-focus reference sphere (removing the field-curvature
defocus of the fast f/1.75 anastigmat); `realize_apertures` uses `std(OPD)` at a
single global image plane, leaving that defocus in the off-center corners. It is
a WFE-metric/reference-sphere convention difference, **not an optical error**.

### 4b. The offset FPA tilt is large and its own finding

At the 0.5° offset field, `align_focal_plane` fits a **repeatable 14.24° focal-
plane tilt** (grid=0 and grid=5 agree to 4 dp; a fast anastigmat genuinely has a
strongly tilted image surface off-axis). At that tilt no single mmacos metric
equals Rodgers' 79/375/200 nm (raw 724–4959, −tilt 452–2455, −focus 232–1255,
−astig 19–67 nm over the box). Whether CODE V's FPA "tilt/focus" DOF converges
to the same surface, and exactly which reference-sphere its field-map RMS uses
off-axis, is the open question for Fable.

### 4c. Stage-4 rigid-body values disagree

| | MACOS | Rodgers | ratio |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ydec_M2 (mm) | −2.17 | 8.34 | −0.26× |
| tilt_M2 (deg) | 0.14 | 0.517 | 0.27× |
| Ydec_M3 (mm) | −25.6 | 121.87 | −0.21× |
| tilt_M3 (deg) | 0.64 | 2.330 | 0.28× |

MACOS finds M2/M3 moves in the *same rough proportion* (M3 ≫ M2, tilt ~4×
Ydec-scaled) but ~4–5× smaller and opposite-signed on the decenters. Expected:
once the optimization **objective** differs (the metric of §4a, plus the
different off-axis FPA-tilt handling of §4b), the minimizer lands on a different
rigid-body balance. The rigid-body solution is only comparable once the merit
function matches CODE V's field-map RMS — the §4a/§4b item gates this.

---

## 5. Open questions for Fable (do NOT tune past these)

1. **Field-map RMS metric.** Make `realize_apertures`/the field-map evaluator
   offer a CODE V-consistent **per-field best-focus reference-sphere RMS** (§4a
   shows it reconciles the on-axis stage to 3%). This is the primary fix; it
   likely also brings §4c into agreement by matching the optimization objective.
2. **Off-axis FPA model.** Is CODE V's field-map RMS at the offset field taken on
   a **tilted** focal surface, and does its "FPA tilt/focus" DOF reach the same
   ~14° surface? (§4b.) The tilt vignettes the per-field decomposition.
3. **EPD confirmation.** 2000 mm was inferred from the layout drawing (§1). A
   CODE V `.seq`/EPD readout would remove the one unpinned input. WFE-in-waves
   scales with aperture, so this must be exact before absolute-WFE agreement is
   meaningful. (Conic *values*, §3, are aperture-robust — hence they match.)

## 6. Artifacts

- `rodgers1.m` — the parameter-driven driver (4 stages; knobs: stages, EPD_mm,
  lambda_nm, model_size, map_n, opt_n, max_iters, save, plots).
- `rodgers_common.m` — verbatim prescription + Rodgers' ground-truth stats.
- `rodgers1_stage{1..4}.in` — the emitted MACOS prescriptions (SMACOS-validated).
- `rodgers1_stage{1..4}_*.png` — the RMS-WFE field maps.
- `rodgers1_results.mat` — per-stage stats, conics, rigid-body, metric ladders.
- `diag_*.m` — the diagnostics behind §2–§4 (focus, grid convergence, metric
  ladder, aperture sweep, FPA strategy) — kept for reproducibility.

## 7. Engine/API change made for this study

`macos.design.Telescope/optimize` gained a **per-element DOF mask**: `dofs` may
now be `(Nv,8)` (one VarElt row per varied mirror) in addition to the shared
`(1,8)` row. Stage 4 needs it — M1 held rigid (conic only) while M2/M3 add
Ydec+α-tilt, so there is no global-tilt gauge freedom to corrupt the solved
rigid-body values. Back-compatible; covered by
`tDesignTelescope/test_optimize_per_element_dofs` (suite 68/68 green).
